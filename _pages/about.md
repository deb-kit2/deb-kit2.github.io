#### Work Experience
- <b>Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>**Research and Development Engineer**</i> ~ June 2022 - Present<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I work in the Natural Language Understanding team. Mostly doing research and maintaining a key module in the Bixby pipeline.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are we doing? Can't say much, but check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2MGqmuEdtU) out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>**Student Trainee**</i> ~ May - July 2021 [ðŸ“œ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14E4fWz0ZZLIqTw-hjEKaOEyDz61U79IY/view?usp=sharing)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worked on the interpretability of Language Models for Intent Classification and Slot Tagging tasks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used [Language Interpretability Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/) (LIT) and [Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) (LIME).

- <b>NxTechWorks Consulting Pvt. Ltd., Pune</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>**Machine Learning Intern**</i> ~ Dec 2020 - Jan 2021 [ðŸ“œ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lHkSa7woRo4Yas3-nA4c3a2JfBQrIW5W/view?usp=sharing)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was aksed to develop a generic object detection and localization framework.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also some OCR apps for template based info extraction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe, this was fun - implemented deskew and denoise for scans using Hough
transform and Thresholding.

#### Education
- <b>Indian Institute of Technology (ISM), Dhanbad</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>**Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering**</i> ~ July 2018 - May 2022

#### Some cool projects
- <b>Modeling Chaotic Epidemic Models on FPGAs - Bachelor's Thesis</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a general procedure to implement Chaotic Models.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used Eulerâ€™s Forward method to discretize continuous-time differential equations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then generated RTL Schematics and compared the resources used.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahaa! And using this, I studied period-doubling bifucations & got to the Figenbaum constant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the logistic map and the Genesio-Tesi attractor. Be sure to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk). It's pretty.
- <b>Neural Style Transfer</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implemented the paper, [Artistic Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), by Gatys Leon.

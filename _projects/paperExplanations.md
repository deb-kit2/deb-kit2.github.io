## Papers and Blogs

This page is is the only reason I re-made this website again.
I have tried to cover the details of papers I've authored, or read and found interesting ~ mostly aligned with NLP and Multimodal paradigm.

This is a work-in-progress page. 😅

#### 📄 [Seg-HGNN: Unsupervised and Light-Weight Image Segmentation using Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06589)

#### 📄 [KAM-CoT: Knowledge Augmetned Multimodal Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12863)

#### 🗞️ [Graph Attention Networks](/blog/graphs)
